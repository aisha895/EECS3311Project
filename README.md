# **University Administration System**

Welcome to the University Administration System, a Java-based software application developed as part of the EECS 3311 - Software Design course. This project demonstrates the integration of object-oriented principles, design patterns, and user-centric design for building robust and maintainable software systems.


## Features
The system comes with the following core features:

### Student Management
Add, update, view, and delete student records.
Track academic performance and enrolled courses.
Assign students to specific programs and monitor their progress.

### Course Management
Create new courses with unique IDs, titles, and descriptions.
Manage course prerequisites and associated credits.
Enroll students and assign professors to courses dynamically.

### Professor Management
Add, update, and manage professor profiles.
Assign professors to specific courses.
Maintain a record of professor activity and workload.

### Search and Reporting
Search for students, courses, or professors using keywords.
Generate detailed reports, such as:

### Course enrollment lists.
Individual student performance summaries.
Professor workload distribution.

### Data Persistence
Save and load system data using file-based or database-backed storage.
Ensure data consistency and integrity with robust error handling.


## Project Highlights

### Object-Oriented Design:
Implements SOLID principles to ensure high code quality and maintainability.

### Design Patterns:

*Observer Pattern:* Updates UI components dynamically when data changes.
*Singleton Pattern:* Ensures consistent access to critical resources like data managers.
*Factory Pattern:* Creates different types of user objects (students, professors, etc.) dynamically.
